# POE STASH

Share your stuff with others in Path of Exile!

Tired of not be able to show what you have to others? This tool is for you!

This project let you fetch your whole account and generate an html file with all
your stuff, browsable as if you were in game.

### Goal

Share a stash with a friend:
  * Easily
  * Nothing to install (if hosted)
  * Portable (should be compatible with everything)
  * Simple to use
  * Intuitive (very similar as the in-game interface)

## Items pricing

This project also allows you to manage your item prices easily. It's not its
main feature, and will not replace more advanced dedicated tool, but it's still
useful (at least for me!).

Read some explanation here: [Pricing items](prices.md)

## I need your help!

I'm facing some issues, I could use a hand:
  * English is not my first language, thus checking this documentation is
    correctly written would be great!
  * I don't have some premium stash type. So I don't know how to handle them. If
    you have special stash tabs, send me the generated json, so I can start to
    support them.
  * I don't know how a *remove stash only* behave. Would be interesed as well.
  * Do you have a character with a lot of jewels? Would like to know how it
    behave in my tools.

Thanks you!
