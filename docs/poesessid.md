## Note about the POE sessid

Never ever share your POE session id! This token is used to identify you on the
official website. This tool need it to fetch all information about your account,
but you should not share it. If a website ask your poesessid (and it's not
launched by you locally or somone you trust), you should not give it!

Someone with this session could impersonate you, change your passwords and stole
your account and items!
