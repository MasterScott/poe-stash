# POE STASH

## Frequently asked questions

### Your currencies are not up to date

Yes, it's hard coded, not live. They will never be exact, or intended to be.
It's just a way to see how your general wealth is.

### There are already some better tools to price items

I'm not concurrencing acquisition or procurement, it's just a small feature I'm
using, because, why not :). Of course there are more advanced tools, which are
making a better job than this tool.

This tool is mainly to share stash with others.

### How can I support this project?

Just use it and share it! I will never ask for tips, or any kind of donation. No
need to send anything.
