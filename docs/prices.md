the top left corner. It will copy a special text in your clipboard. Simply paste
everything (replace all), then submit.

associated with the exact url name. It means all prices will be lost if you:

  * Use another browser
  * Clear the browser cache
  * Reinstall your browser
  * Open the file on another device

which allows you to save and reload the prices you set.

the text file containing prices.
